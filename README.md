The purpose of this code assignment is to build a simple Android app to display a list of 

movies using themoviedb.org API and to allow the user to get more details about each 

movie she clicks onto.

IMPORTANT: It is necessary to replace with a valid YOUTUBE API KEY placed in com.app.movies.internal.DeveloperKey in order to
reproduce the Trailer of the Movie
